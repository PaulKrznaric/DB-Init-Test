## Testing out postgresql and IAS ##
The purpose of this is for me to have an idea of what an RDS PostgreSQL server looks like and how it's managed. I want to be able to deploy it to AWS, back-up data, migrate data, and update the DB with migration scripts. This should all be automated. 
Currently the planned automation path is GitHub Actions.
