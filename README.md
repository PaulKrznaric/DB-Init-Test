## Testing out postgresql and IAS ##
The purpose of this is for me to have an idea of what an RDS PostgreSQL server looks like and how it's managed. I want to be able to deploy it to AWS, back-up data, migrate data, and update the DB with migration scripts. 

Currently the database is deployable and destroyable via terraform to AWS and has an intial setup script.
